## Content

Goals: To create a balance platform that can vibrate at pseudorandom pattern to test the Bipedal robot. 
Dr. Hunt wants the platform to be able to generate a motion following the pseudo random ternary sequence to test the bipedal robot. When the robot is tested on this platform, the transfer function of the bipedal robot can be derived.
